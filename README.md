Welcome to the repository for Merytas, a mock social media site that I am using to hone my full-stack development skills. The backend server is located in the directory "backend" and runs on Java Spring Boot, while the front end is located in the folder "clients/merytas-web-app" and runs on React integrated with TypeScript. Users have the ability to like posts, view content specific to them, interact with other users, and follow forums. As of now, both the front and backend are hosted on a local server and API calls are currently from one server to the other. The integration of them together, as well as improved security measures are forthcoming.
